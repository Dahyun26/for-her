      <p>I’ll never forget this picture. This was our first picture together and also our first time meeting. Those days made me so happy. For others, it might just be a normal date and a photo, but for me, it’s different because it was the first time I got to go to that place and take a picture with the person I like. I will never forget that day.</p>

      <p>This video is our first photobooth.
It was my first time experiencing a photobooth, and I couldn’t explain what I was feeling at that moment. I was nervous because you were beside me, and at the same time I was excited because it was my first time. To be honest, I didn’t know what to do during those moments. You may not see it in the video, but I was clearly nervous and panicking.
In the end, I was still happy and so were we because we experienced that together. And from that day on, the idea never left my mind that every month we would take pictures in a photobooth, and that it would become one of our bonding moments visiting photobooths one by one wherever we go.</p>

      <p>This picture is one of my favorite picture of you because it was the first time I was the photographer. You were so cute and beautiful at that moment, which is why I took your picture. And until now, you are still so beautiful, so I will never get tired of taking photos of you. That was our first date, and it was my first time with you, which is why I will never forget those memories.</p>

      <p>These days are our midterms, and this is the first time we studied together. It makes me so proud to see you studying and doing your best to review. After midterms week, I’m extremely proud of you because you gave your best reviewing and answering your exams even though I know you struggled at times and had moments of doubt. But because of your hard work, you passed everything. I’m always here, your number one fan, supporting you in everything you want to achieve./p>

      <p>That day was your birthday, and I was so happy because I was able to be there to celebrate it with you. It was our first time having samgyupsal and my first time meeting your friends. Throughout that entire day, the only thing on my mind was how I could make your birthday happy and unforgettable. Yes, I was still shy during those days because we had only just gotten to know each other, but I did my best to give you the gifts you wanted and to be with you on your birthday. That day already made me happy because you were happy on your birthday.</p>
