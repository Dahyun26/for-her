      <p>This video was taken when we were eating at the plaza before we went to the church. Going to the church became one of our dates since the time I asked you out, and it was also the first time we went out together. I wanted to take pictures and videos of you because you looked so beautiful, and I was admiring you during those moments, even while we were eating. I was thinking about how much I really liked you, and without realizing it, I had already fallen deeply for you. I wanted to hug and kiss you at that time, if only it were possible HAHAHA. But that’s the main reason why I took a video of you back then: because I was admiring how beautiful you are, and I didn’t want to waste that moment. Taking a video was my way of saving it as a memory.</p>

      <p>This video was taken on November 19, the day after you said yes to me. We don’t have a video or photo from the moment you accepted me, so I’ll include this instead in our November dump HAHAHA. I will never forget this day, our first day as a couple. It was also the day I bought you something to eat bread and peanut butter. As your boyfriend, I’ll do everything I can, and as much as I’m able to, I’ll buy you the things you want. That’s one of the efforts I want to do for you, to show you and make you feel how deeply I love you, baby. I love you always.</p>

      <p>This picture was taken on the day of your defense. I wanted to show my support for my girlfriend, so I went to the school and waited for you to finish so I could congratulate you. I am so proud of you on that day. All the hard work and sleepless nights were worth it. This semester, there is one more defense, and I hope that once you have successfully defended, we can be together again in that same place to take another picture. I also hope I can be there on the day of your defense to show you my support.</p>

      <p>This picture was taken when the lights at the plaza had just been turned on. We went to church, then ate together, and after that we took a picture. That was the first time I went to the plaza with someone during the light display and took a picture with the person I love, which is why I will never forget it. We became each other’s photographers, and on our future dates, I hope we continue to be photographers for one another. Here’s to more memories and more pictures with you. So don’t hesitate to take pictures for our memories, because I will keep them here even if we don’t post them to our stories, we’ll save them here.</p>
