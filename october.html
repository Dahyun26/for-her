      <p>That day was the first time I went with you to Rosario to feed your cats. At first, you might have doubted whether I would really come with you because it was far, but because I already cared about you at that time, I was willing to go with you as long as I could. Even if I get tired, as long as I’m with you and you’re safe, it’s okay with me. I may not be able to come with you every time you go to Rosario, but whenever I can, I will go with you.</p>

      <p>That day was when we tried the Potato Corner combo. As far as I remember, we both had classes that day. I know you were tired, but you still made the effort to come and spend time with me. Those little things made me like you even more. Even though we only saw each other for a short time that day, we talked about so many things. I got to know you better, and we also tried a lot of games together. We enjoyed eating together with endless conversations, and even while we were on the jeepney going home and walking toward your dorm, we still had so much to talk about.</p>

      <p>That day was another new experience for me. We tried Woonmart and explored Korean food. I didn’t know what to do in a store like that, but because I was with you that day, I felt comfortable and confident that I’d be able to buy things properly HAHAHA. Since I didn’t have enough money that day, you paid for all my food, and because of that, I decided that I would give you everything I can, as much as I’m able to. I’m also sorry that we went there so suddenly even though we weren’t ready. That’s why, until now, I’m doing my best to make it up to you in every way I can.</p>

      <p> The last memory from October that I will never forget is our second photobooth. I will never forget how I sneaked away from my classmates that day because I really wanted us to try the photobooth at your event. It was embarrassing because I was wearing my CICS ID lace, but because I really wanted us to have our second photobooth, I pushed my shyness aside. zWe did so many things that day. We walked around your event, and after that, we watched the intramurals. I still remember how we even made a bet HAHAHA and we also saw ourselves on Facebook Live during the game.</p>
