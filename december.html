      <p>This picture was taken during our outing. It was our first date at the beach, and I was so happy to be with you swimming and enjoying the sea together. It has always been one of my dreams to go to the beach with the person I love. Even though we didn’t get to stay overnight or have a bonfire with them, we were still happy, even if we had to go home early. That day, we promised to make it up to each other because we left early and now, here we are. We’re going to celebrate our monthsary at the beach, and we’ll finally make up for it.</p>

      <p>This video was taken when we went to Lipa. It was the first time we traveled far together, just the two of us, and we were incredibly happy. We enjoyed all the rides and slides until we ran out of energy from playing so much. You said that the next time you went there, you would bring me with you and you kept that promise. You brought me to a place where I felt truly happy, and we will go back there to play again. We took many photos and videos that day, but I chose this one because it was also the first time we watched fireworks together. You were so beautiful at that moment, just like the fireworks that’s why I didn’t only capture the fireworks in the video.</p>
